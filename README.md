Final_Project for by SI 206 class 

Using the PRAW wrapper, I was able to access Reddits data and use it to extract the data from Reddit. Reddit requires an OAUTH2  authentication. You are able to access Reddit's API by providing some information about your Reddit account including: the client secret, the client Id, your username and your password. 

To access this information, these are the steps the user must follow: 
1. the user must log into Reddit on https://www.reddit.com/. 
2. Go to the top right of the Page where your uniquename is displayed and press on it. 
3. Go to Preferences 



Data sources used, including instructions for a user to access the data sources (e.g., API keys or client secrets needed, along with a pointer to instructions on how to obtain these and instructions for how to incorporate them into your program (e.g., secrets.py file format))
Any other information needed to run the program (e.g., pointer to getting started info for plotly)
Brief description of how your code is structured, including the names of significant data processing functions (just the 2-3 most important functions--not a complete list) and class definitions. If there are large data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) that you create to organize your data for presentation, briefly describe them.
Brief user guide, including how to run the program and how to choose presentation options.
